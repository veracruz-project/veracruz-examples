# Larger, more-involved example Veracruz computations

This [main Veracruz repository](https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz) hosts a variety of small example computations that can be deployed on Veracruz.
These are mainly used for tutorial purposes, and also for integration testing.
This repository hosts larger, more realistic, and more involved example Veracruz applications.

# Get involved!

We welcome contributions of new example privacy-preserving computations that can be deployed with Veracruz.
To contribute, please clone this repository and open a pull request with your changes.
